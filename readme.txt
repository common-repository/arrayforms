**Drag & Drop Form Builder for WordPress**

BuildForms by Array is completely optimized for use on WordPress. From the WordPress admin dashboard you can create custom forms, view your form submission data and analytics, and set up complex workflows and automations. BuildForms is smart, letting you do more with your forms than any other WordPress form plugin on the market. 

Choose from one of our existing templates or create your own form from scratch. With BuildForms, the possibilities are as limitless as your business’ opportunities to grow. Generate quotes, use complex calculation forms, create advanced lead generation forms, build customer questionnaires and surveys, or make lead qualification and onboarding workflows. The possibilities are endless. 

**View Data in a New Way**

If you are collecting customer data, its most likely because you need it to make decisions. The BuildForms plugin makes this incredibly simple by providing a reports overview right in your WordPress dashboard. You can see important data and metrics based on your form submissions, sort and filter by any metrics you choose, and gain complete oversight of your incoming data. 

You can even export the data to outside programs like Excel or Google Sheets. The Array platform integrates with countless programs so you can make sure your data is where you need it to be, when you need it to be there. 

**We Like Our Logo, But We Like Yours Better**

Visual elements matter to your customers, and you’ve spent a lot of time making your WordPress site look exactly the way you want it to. Why should your web forms be any different? BuildForms lets you change the color scheme and branding of your forms to include your company’s colors and logos. This keeps your site looking professional, and your customers impressed. 

**More Than Just Forms**

Do you have standardized forms that you need to collect from your customers to save for internal reporting? Rather than using a fillable PDF or another method, use one of our web forms for WordPress. Your customers can fill the form out online, sign with a secure e-signature, and then when they submit the form data can automatically be converted into a finalized, standardized PDF document to be stored for your records. Better yet, use BuildForms to create beautiful, fully custom quotes that can be automatically delivered back to your customers’ inbox after they fill out a form.
